# Card-Hover-Effect
Card expands when mouse hovers over

The CSS code sets up a container with flexbox layout and defines the styles for its child elements with class "card".

The container has its "display" property set to "flex", which makes its child elements automatically arranged in a row.

The "card" elements have a purple border with 1-pixel width and rounded corners (border-radius: 20px). They also have a height of 200 pixels, a white background color, and take up equal space within the container with "flex: 1".

When a "card" element is hovered over with a mouse, it transitions to take up twice as much space as the other "card" elements in the container with "flex: 2". It also changes its background color to a light gray (rgb(207,207,207)).

This CSS code can be used to create a responsive grid of cards that expand when hovered over, which can be useful for displaying images, product information, or other content.
